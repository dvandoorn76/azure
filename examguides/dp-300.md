### Implement Azure Key Vault and disk encryption for Azure VMs
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disk-encryption-key-vault

## Implement security for data in transit
### Configure SQL DB and database-level firewall rules
Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics IP firewall rules
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure

**Important!** *Azure Synapse only supports server-level IP firewall rules. It doesn't support database-level IP firewall rules.*

**Recommendations for how to set firewall rules**

We recommend that you use database-level IP firewall rules whenever possible. This practice enhances security and makes your database more portable. Use server-level IP firewall rules for administrators. Also use them when you have many databases that have the same access requirements, and you don't want to configure each database individually.

*Important!*
If you delete the Azure SQL server that hosts SQL databases, all elastic database pools and databases that belong to the server are also deleted. They can't be recovered. You can't restore a deleted server. But if you configured long-term retention, the backups for the databases with LTR won't be deleted, and these databases can be restored.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-database-options-page?view=sql-server-ver15

### Perform a database restore to a point in time
Restore a **Azure SQL Database DB** to a point in Time

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-recovery-using-backups#point-in-time-restore

You can restore a standalone, pooled, or instance database to an earlier point in time by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the REST API. The request can specify any service tier or compute size for the restored database. Ensure that you have sufficient resources on the server to which you are restoring the database. When complete, the restore creates a new database on the same server as the original database. The restored database is charged at normal rates, based on its service tier and compute size. You don't incur charges until the database restore is complete.

Restore a **SQL Server Database** to a Point in Time (Full Recovery Model):
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-sql-server-database-to-a-point-in-time-full-recovery-model

<a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
 **To restore a database to a point in time**  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, connect to the appropriate instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and expand the server tree.  
  
2.  Expand **Databases**. Depending on the database, either select a user database or expand **System Databases**, and then select a system database.  
  
3.  Right-click the database, point to **Tasks**, point to **Restore**, and then click **Database**.  
  
4.  On the **General** page, use the **Source** section to specify the source and location of the backup sets to restore. Select one of the following options:  
  
    -   **Database**  
  
         Select the database to restore from the drop-down list. The list contains only databases that have been backed up according to the **msdb** backup history.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the backup is taken from a different server, the destination server will not have the backup history information for the specified database. In this case, select **Device** to manually specify the file or device to restore.  
  
    -   **Device**  
  
         Click the browse (**...**) button to open the **Select backup devices** dialog box. In the **Backup media type** box, select one of the listed device types. To select one or more devices for the **Backup media** box, click **Add**.  
  
         After you add the devices you want to the **Backup media** list box, click **OK** to return to the **General** page.  
  
         In the **Source: Device: Database** list box, select the name of the database which should be restored.  
  
         **Note** This list is only available when **Device** is selected. Only databases that have backups on the selected device will be available.  
  
5.  In the **Destination** section, the **Database** box is automatically populated with the name of the database to be restored. To change the name of the database, enter the new name in the **Database** box.  
  
6.  Click **Timeline** to access the **Backup Timeline** dialog box.  
  
7.  In the **Restore to** section, click **Specific date and time**.  
  
8.  Use either the **Date** and **Time** boxes or the slider bar to specify a specific date and time to where the restore should stop. [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Use the **Timeline Interval** box to change the amount of time displayed on the timeline.  
  
9. After you have specified a specific point in time, the Database Recovery Advisor ensures that only backups that are required for restoring to that point in time are selected in the **Restore** column of the **Backup sets to restore** grid. These selected backups make up the recommended restore plan for your point-in-time restore. You should use only the selected backups for your point-in-time restore operation.  
  
     For information about the columns in the **Backup sets to restore** grid, see [Restore Database &#40;General Page&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-database-general-page.md). For information about the Database Recovery Advisor, see [Restore and Recovery Overview &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-and-recovery-overview-sql-server.md).  
  
10. On the **Options** page, in the **Restore options** panel, you can select any of the following options, if appropriate for your situation:  
  
    -   **Overwrite the existing database (WITH REPLACE)**  
  
    -   **Preserve the replication settings (WITH KEEP_REPLICATION)**  
  
    -   **Restrict access to the restored database (WITH RESTRICTED_USER)**  
  
     For more information about these options, see [Restore Database &#40;Options Page&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-database-options-page.md).  
  
11. Select an option for the **Recovery state** box. This box determines the state of the database after the restore operation.  
  
    -   **RESTORE WITH RECOVERY** is the default behavior which leaves the database ready for use by rolling back the uncommitted transactions. Additional transaction logs cannot be restored. Select this option if you are restoring all of the necessary backups now.  
  
    -   **RESTORE WITH NORECOVERY** which leaves the database non-operational, and does not roll back the uncommitted transactions. Additional transaction logs can be restored. The database cannot be used until it is recovered.  
  
    -   **RESTORE WITH STANDBY** which leaves the database in read-only mode. It undoes uncommitted transactions, but saves the undo actions in a standby file so that recovery effects can be reverted.  
  
     For descriptions of the options, see [Restore Database &#40;Options Page&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-database-options-page.md).  
  
12. **Take tail-log backup before restore** will be selected if it is necessary for the point in time that you have selected. You do not need to modify this setting, but you can choose to backup the tail of the log even if it is not required.  
  
13. Restore operations may fail if there are active connections to the database. Check the **Close existing connections option** to ensure that all active connections between [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] and the database are closed. This check box sets the database to single user mode before performing the restore operations, and sets the database to multi-user mode when complete.  
  
14. Select **Prompt before restoring each backup** if you wish to be prompted between each restore operation. This is not usually necessary unless the database is large and you wish to monitor the status of the restore operation.
